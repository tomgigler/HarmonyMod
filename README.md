# HarmonyMod

HarmonyMod is an interactive moderation bot designed to primarily utilize slash commands, buttons, context menus, and selection menu events for the bulk of the commands.

Moderation will primarily be achieved using the Mod Panel at /mod @member

I will add features here as they are added and tested.

You can find me in the Harmony support server here: https://discord.gg/WaqVCZyVr7
